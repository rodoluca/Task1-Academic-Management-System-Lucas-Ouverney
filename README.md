# Task1 - Project Title: Academic Management System

### Project Description:
Design and develop an Academic Management System using SQL. The projects should involve
three tables 1. StudentInfo 2. CoursesInfo 3. EnrollmentInfo. The Aim is to create a system that
allows for managing student information and course enrollment. 

The project will include the following tasks:

### 1.Database Creation:
a) Create the StudentInfo table with columns STU_ ID, STU_NAME, DOB, PHONE_NO,
EMAIL_ID,ADDRESS.

b) Create the CoursesInfo table with columns COURSE_ID,
COURSE_NAME,COURSE_INSTRUCTOR NAME.

c) Create the EnrollmentInfo with columns ENROLLMENT_ID, STU_ ID, COURSE_ID,
ENROLL_STATUS (Enrolled/Not Enrolled). The FOREIGN KEY constraint in the EnrollmentInfo
table references the STU_ID column in the StudentInfo table and the COURSE_ID column in the
CoursesInfo table.

### 2.Data Creation:
Insert some sample data for StudentInfo table, CoursesInfo table, EnrollmentInfo with
respective fields.

### 3) Retrieve the Student Information.
a) Write a query to retrieve student details, such as student name, contact information, and
Enrollment status.

b) Write a query to retrieve a list of courses in which a specific student is enrolled.

c) Write a query to retrieve course information, including course name, instructor information.
d) Write a query to retrieve course information for a specific course.

e) Write a query to retrieve course information for multiple courses.

f) Test the queries to ensure accurate retrieval of student information (execute the queries and
verify the results against the expected output).

### 4. Reporting and Analytics (Using joining queries).
a) Write a query to retrieve the number of students enrolled in each course.
b) Write a query to retrieve the list of students enrolled in a specific course.
c) Write a query to retrieve the count of enrolled students for each instructor.
d) Write a query to retrieve the list of students who are enrolled in multiple courses.
